# learning-haskell-exercises-examples

This repository refers to the notes and our initial steps in learning Haskell. For that, we have followed the instructions for the following tutorial: 

[Learn You a Haskell for Great Good! ](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters)

This book contains the original content of the examples presented in the Jupyter notebooks. So please, make reference to the original authors when cited. 

Similarly, good set of exercises are presented in the following github repository and transformed into the Jupynet notebook for facilitating the visualization. The original 
exercises can be found here: 

[Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!- Exercises ](https://github.com/noelmarkham/learn-you-a-haskell-exercises)

## Getting Started

To copy the projct you only need to fork it or download it into your local machine. We recomend to read firstly the chapter of the book to better 
comprehend the examples presented. Finally, we propose to make the exercises by your own, checking the proposed solutions.

## Installing

For running the examples in your local machine, you only need to install Docker: 

[Docker installation guides ](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

After that, you have to download IHaskell docker file and run it, for example using Kitematic:

## Built With

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) - Docker runner for the containers.
* [IHaskell](https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell) - Running Haskell virtual machine in IPython (Jupyter Notebooks).
